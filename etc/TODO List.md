# TODO List

1. Improve the CSS.
2. Load the image to the input of this one when you edit a post because currently this one doesn't receive anything, so you don't have to load the same original image again from the client.
3. In the search panel, keep the search parameters when you search by word or tag.
4. Improve the notifications in terms of appearance on the screen and its aesthetics.
5. Improve the code nomenclature (like camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase).
6. Apply more the "DRY" development principle and/or Decentralize, Distribute, Delegate even more functions or tasks in the code.
7. Improve the README and translate it into English and German.
8. Take screenshots of the project and upload them to the README once an acceptable level of aesthetics has been reached.
9. Apply the DRY principle for links to CSS files in HTML files.
10. Do not allow the user to make more than one click on a button to avoid problems of duplicates or null elements.
11. Improve the content of the posts to make them more realistic.
12. Make the image of the post in my showPosts display correctly for different screen sizes.
